# U.S.-Pollution-Analysis-Dashboard-Project
This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing U.S. air pollution (2006-2010) for NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, SO‚ÇÇ, and CO. Features include state/city trends, AQI insights, pollutant-specific pages, and dynamic slicers. Visualizations include maps, charts, and tables to aid data-driven decisions on air quality.

## Description: 
This repository contains a comprehensive project analyzing air pollution data in the United States from 2006 to 2010. The project focuses on four major pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ), Ozone (O‚ÇÉ), Sulfur Dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Using Power BI for data visualization, the project provides an interactive dashboard offering insights into pollution trends, including:

- State and city-wise analysis of pollutants.
- Historical trends and year-wise AQI statistics.
- Top polluted states and cities for each pollutant.
- Interactive features like slicers and sync slicers for dynamic filtering.
- Visualizations like filled maps, line charts, and tables highlighting AQI values, maxima, and other metrics.

Key features include pollution summaries, pollutant-specific pages, and navigation tools for easy exploration of insights. This project aims to enhance understanding and decision-making regarding air quality in the U.S.

## Files Included:
- Analyzation (U.S Pollution).docx.pdf**: Documentation outlining the data analysis process, requirements, and report designs.
- US_Pollution_report_dashboard_project.pbix**: Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard and visualizations.

Feel free to explore, replicate, and enhance the project for your learning or professional purposes üåç
